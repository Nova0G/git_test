hello world!
I am learning all about Git plus GitHub!
I learned a ton of things about HTML tags and elements today!
I learned to set the DOCTYPE at the top to tell the browser what ver of HTML im using.
Then I learned to set a meta tag to denote the charset, which is usually UTC-8!
I also learned about bolding and italicizing (<strong> and <em>)
